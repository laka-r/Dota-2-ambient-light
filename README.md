Upload the Arduino code to your board, no need to change this code. The only changes you need to make are on the Processing code,
because it was made to work on 1366x768 resolution, so adjust the variables accordingly.
Variables are adjusted for the new UI (7.00).
Coding is rough, and was done quickly as a weekend project, no updates or maintenance in sight.
